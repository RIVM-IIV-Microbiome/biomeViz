In the last years at the RIVM much research has been done on data management and on the development of statistical methods for “data wrangling” (such as cleaning, transforming, merging data…), as well as for visualization of complex multivariable associations. The toolbox will implement these already available developments in combination with the new requirements in a user-friendly format, using the R language, and making them available to the scientific community within the RIVM as well as (inter)nationally.

## biomeViz  
`biomeViz` focus is towards data visualization for microbiota. Data visualization is done mostly using the ggplot2 and related family of R packages.  
The package is <span style="color:red">undergoing development</span>.
